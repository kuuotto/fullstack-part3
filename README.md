# fullstack-part3
My submission for part 3 of the University of Helsinki Full Stack course

Instead of Postman or the VS Code REST client, I used [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/). The collection of API requests is in the contacts-api folder.

The backend API is available here: https://fullstack-contacts-api.onrender.com
